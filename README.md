# Quickstart

- Clone the repository
- [Create a Project and Client ID using Google's Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project)
- Replace the `client_id` value on line `12` of the file `main.js` with your project's Client ID.
- Assuming you set your project's Authorized JavaScript origin and Authorized redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080`, then use a webserver like Python's Simple HTTP Server to run your app.
